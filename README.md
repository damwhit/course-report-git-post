## What is git and what are its origins?

Git is a Version Control System (VCS), which in a nutshell, means that it's a
tool that allows developers keep track of the differences in a codebase over
time. We create versions of a 'repository' (A folder with git tracking turned
on, which may contain files and subfolders ie. a codebase) through a series of
**intentional** snapshots called ‘commits’. You've likely experienced less
sophisticated version control type features such as microsoft word's 'go back'
feature that allows you to go back to previously saved version of a file. Git
takes it to the next level by allowing us to decide exactly when we save a
version of a project and it allows us to provide annotations when doing so. 

Git was originally developed by Linus Torvalds, while maintaining the Linux
kernel (An operating system that runs the majority of smartphones, tablets,
servers, and supercomputers across the globe) in April of 2005, because the team
lost free access to their current VCS at the time. It is an actively maintained
open source project that can be found on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/git/git).

## What is git used for? Can you give some examples?

Git is used for keeping track of projects over time. It provides a way to save
multiple files and folders associated with the same project all at once, instead
of individually. 

Imagine that you're writing a blog post that has multiple files
associated with it. You may have one main text file which is the actual post, an
additional file for references, as well as some other files that are diagrams
and other images. 

Without Git, you may have all of these various files stored in a folder on your
computer, but there is no way to tell the status of all of these moving pieces
at different points in time. With Git we can track the entire repository at
various points in time using commits. When we get our blog post to a good place,
we are able to save every file at once by making a commit, and provide annotations 
on where it is at that point in time. Having all of these commits provides a
clear history of our project and a means to travel back in time to previous
versions of the project.

You may think that a blog post is a contrived example, however codebases are
really not that different. They are at their most basic level, a series of text
and image files that are linked to one another. When a developer is
working on a certain feature, Git provides a means to save a snapshot of our
repository via commit. This is usually done when incremental progress has been
made and the feature is roughly bug free. In making the commit, the developer
can provide annotations around the what and the why the feature was built. This
message adds to the history of the project and can make it easy to determine
when a certain feature or bug was introduced. 

## What is Github and what are its origins? How did its creation change the way people collaborate?  
Note: I’ve heard nice comparisons in the past to Google
Drive that explain the concept of version control to a beginner – if you have an
analogy like that, it would be great!

## How important is it for beginner coders to learn how to use git?  
### Is this something you learn in a CS degree? 

## How are git and Github incorporated into the Turing curriculum?  
### Why teach Github over another service like Bitbucket?
There are a few reasons for that. GitHub was the first and is now the most ubiquitous hosting
service for Git repositories. It has also been fundamental in making Git more
approachable. On a more personal level, it was built in ruby (the first language
that we taught at Turing) and has been really supportive to the ruby community.
The organization has also been super supportive of us as a non profit
organization by providing free unlimited public and private repositories, and it
just so happens that we have 10 or so alums and/or former teachers that work
there.
